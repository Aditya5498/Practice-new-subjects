2) pandas -> organize data in a tabular form and to attach descriptive labels to the rows and columns
3) scipy -> contains a lot of tools for scientific calclations for ML, engineering, maths
4) statsmodels -> built on top of NumPy and SciPy which integrates with pandas and provides good summary
5) matplotlib -> 2D plotting library specially designed for visualization of NumPy Computations
6) seaborn -> data visualition for high level maths
